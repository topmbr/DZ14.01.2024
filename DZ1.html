    <h3><span style="color: #666699;">ACT 1</span></h3>
    <h3><span style="color: #666699;">PROLOGUE</span></h3>
    <p>Two households, both alike in dignity,<br /> In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br /> From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br /> Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br /> From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br /> A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br /> Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br /> Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br /> The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love<br /> And the continuance of their parents' rage<br /> Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br /> Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br /> The which if you with patient ears attend,<br /> What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>
    <h3><span style="color: #666699;">SCENE I. Verona. A public place</span></h3>
    <p><em><small>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and buckiers</small></em></p>
    <h3><span style="color: #666699;">SAMPSON</span></h3>
    <p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals</p>
    <h3><span style="color: #666699;">GREGORY</span></h3>
    <p>No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
